I re-ran the experiment with only one change: instead of the the input language having 4 symbols, and 1 being left out of the support set, I used a language with 5 symbols, with one being left out of the support set again. Given that this is a straightforward extension of the original experiment, we expect no changes."

    "When we train the model on the `CompNoME` task, we see that the model is still able to capture compositionality, but only among symbols it has seen. This is seen in the 100% retrieval accuracy (retrieval here is redefined to mean query samples that only contain input symbols present in the support set). \n",

    "The generalisation set (defined here to mean query set samples that contain the symbol omitted from the support), however, does not cause the model to fail completely. The model still has an accuracy on these samples of 23.9%, which is close to the chance of choosing the correct mapping for the held-out symbol uniformly at random (25%). So, we observe that the model does not consistently map the held-out symbol these experiments, as was the case in the original mutual exclusivity experiments."
